        Strange the falls.
        Thrilling ventures there abound,
        A bear which weighed eight hundred pounds,
        Hunters they do him discover
        As he was swimming down the river.

        They felt he would be glorious prize
        This grand fat bear of mighty size,
        Three men they jump'd into canoe,
        A skilful and determined crew.

        Soon alongside of him they row,
        But kindly feelings he doth show,
        Quick he scrambled o'er the boat side
        For to enjoy a good boat ride.

        And as o'er the side he straddles
        They hit him on head with paddles,
        But all in vain, so two of crew
        A short time bade the bear adieu.

        And soon they swiftly swam to shore,
        But current down the river bore
        Man, bear and boat, the sound appals
        Of roaring mighty water falls.

        But vigorous now he plys the oar,
        In hopes to safely reach the shore,
        But this made bear to grin and growl
        And wear on brow a horrid scowl.

        So poor man sore against his will
        Finds that in boat he must keep still,
        Or else be hugged to death by bear,
        While sound of falls becomes more near.

        But his two friends so brave and true
        Row quick 'longside in a canoe,
        And fire in bruin leaden balls,
        Thus saving friend from bear and falls.
